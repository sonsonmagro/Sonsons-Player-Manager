## Usage

### Basic Initialization

```lua
local PlayerManager = require("player_manager")

-- Create a basic configuration
local config = {
    health = {
        normal = { type = "percent", value = 50 },
        critical = { type = "current", value = 2000 },
        special = { type = "percent", value = 65 } -- excalibur threshold
    },
    prayer = {
        normal = { type = "percent", value = 20 },
        critical = { type = "current", value = 100 },
        special = { type = "current", value = 600 } -- elven ritual shard threshold
    },
    locations = {
        { name = "Static location", coords = { x = 123, y = 456, range = 0 } },
        { name = "Dynamic location", detector = function() return customDetectionFunction() end }
    },
    statuses = {
        {
            name = "Doing specific thing",
            condition = function(self) return self.state.location == "Static Location" end,
            execute = function() doSpecificActions() end, -- what to do if these conditions are met
            priority = 1 -- highest priority wins
        },
        -- add more statuses as need be
    }
}

local playerManager = PlayerManager.new(config)
```

### Initialize Buffs

```lua
buffs = {
    {
        buffName = "Overload",
        buffId = 23725,
        refreshAt = 30, -- seconds remaining before refresh
        execute = function() 
            return API.DoAction_Inventory1(23725, 0, 1, API.OFF_ACT_GeneralInterface_route) 
        end,
        canApply = function(self) 
            return self.state.inCombat 
        end
    },
    {
        buffName = "Scripture of Ful",
        buffId = 48242,
        toggle = true, -- can be toggled off
        execute = function()
            return API.DoAction_Inventory1(48242, 0, 1, API.OFF_ACT_GeneralInterface_route)
        end
    }
}
```
#### Buff Configuration Attributes

| Attribute | Required | Type | Description |
|-----------|:--------:|:----:|-------------|
| `buffName` | Yes | `string` | The name of your buff. Used for using the appropriate ability or inventory item |
| `buffId` | Yes | `number` | Used to check against active player buffs |
| `execute` | Yes | `function` | Function called to apply the buff |
| `canApply` | No | `boolean` or `function` | Used to determine if the buff needs to be activated. Can be a static boolean or a function that returns a boolean |
| `toggle` | No | `boolean` | Boolean value that determines whether or not this buff should be re-activated to toggle off |
| `refreshAt` | No | `number` | Remaining time on buff before it should be reapplied |

### Managing Health, Prayer and Buffs

Health, prayer and buffs can be managed however you'd like as long as you call on the appropriate methods and define the buffs according to your liking.

**Example using built-in status handler**
```lua
Config.playerManager = {
    statuses = {
        {
            name = "Waiting for Boss...",
            condition = function(self)
                return (self.state.location == "Rasial's Citadel (Boss Room)") and (#Utils.findAll(30165, 1, 20) == 0)
            end,
            execute = function(self)
                fightRotation:execute()      -- rotation_manager
                prayerFlicker:update()       -- prayer flicker (shameless plug)
                self:manageHealth()
                self:managePrayer()
                self:manageBuffs(buffs)  
            end,
            priority = 1
        }
        -- Can add more statuses according to what you need handled
    }
}

while API.Read_LoopyLoop() do
    playerManager:update()
    API.RandomSleep2(100, 30, 20)
end
```

### Updating Player State

Add `playerManager:update()` to your main loop.

```lua
while API.Read_LoopyLoop() do
    playerManager:update()           -- That's it lol
    doOtherStuff()                   -- Add the rest of your cod
    API.RandomSleep2(100, 30, 20)    -- Sleep for 100ms
end
```

### Advanced Usage

#### Continuous Monitoring

```lua
while API.Read_LoopyLoop() do
    -- Update player state and perform automatic management
    playerManager:update()
    
    -- Retrieve and process tracking metrics
    local stateMetrics = playerManager:stateTracking()
    local managedBuffs = playerManager:managedBuffsTracking()
    local activeBuffs = playerManager:activeBuffsTracking()
    local managementMetrics = playerManager:managementTracking()
    local foodMetrics = playerManager:foodStuffsTracking()
    local prayerMetrics = playerManager:prayerStuffsTracking()
    
    -- Custom processing or display
    API.DrawTable(stateMetrics)
    
    API.RandomSleep2(100, 30, 20)
end
```

#### Manual Calls

```lua
-- Manually check buffs and debuffs from your main script
local buff   = playerManager:getBuff(BUFF_ID)
local debuff = playerManager:getDebuff(DEBUFF_ID)

-- Manually use Enhanced Excalibur and Elven Ritual Shard 
playerManager:useExcalibur()     -- automatically checks if in inventory or equipped
playerManager:useElvenShard()    -- also checks for debuff before attempting to use

-- Add custom locations dynamically (static and dynamic locations!)
playerManager:addStaticLocation({name = "Custom Area", coords = { x = 1234, y = 5678, range = 50 }})
playerManager:addDynamicLocation({name = "Boss Area", detectionFn = function() return interfaceExists(bossTimerInterface) end})

-- Eat food and restore prayer [no need to define what to eat or drink!]
playerManager:oneTickEat(playerHealth < 1000)  -- paramater is for eating food that would drain adren
playerManager:drink()                          -- drinks first available prayer restoring item
```

## Configuration Options

### Threshold Types

- `type`: Define thresholds as `"percent"` or `"current"`
- Supports flexible configuration for health, prayer, and special item usage
- Config example for health and prayer:
   ```lua
  Config.health = {
      normal = { type = "percent", value = 50 },
      critical = { type = "current", value = 2000 },
      special = { type = "percent", value = 65 } -- excalibur threshold
  }
  
  Config.prayer = {
      normal = { type = "percent", value = 20 },
      critical = { type = "current", value = 100 },
      special = { type = "current", value = 600 } -- elven ritual shard threshold
  }
  ```
   
### Location Detection

- Detects the player's location based on the provided conditions
- Locations can be dynamic or static based on how they're defined
  ```lua
  Config.locations = {
      { name = "Static Location", coords = { x = 123, y = 456, range = 20 } },
      { name = "Dynamic Location", detectod = function() return customDetectionFunction() end }
  }
  ```
